			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hello! Thanks for taking the time to check out my portfolio. You can check out my resume <a href="https://zerathemant.github.io/my-portfolio/latest_resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></p>

				I am Reuben Daniel E. Domondon and I'm an aspiring developer. I graduated from STI College Dasmari√±as with a degree of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology batch '20. My main languages of interest are Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. My hobbies are eating, sleeping, reading about history, boxing, and learning guitar even though I'm left-handed.
